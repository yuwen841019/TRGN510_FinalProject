## Author:

## Overview of project
- RNA-Seq is now widely used as a tool for gene expression profiling. It detects differentially expressed genes between conditions. For my project, I am looking at clear cell renal cell carcinoma stage i and people who self-report is while male versus black/African American.
- The objective is to identify differentially expressed genes by using Bioconductor.
