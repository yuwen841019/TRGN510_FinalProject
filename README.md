## Title: Differential expression analysis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma stage i genes for white male versus black/African American male

## Overview of project
- RNA-Seq is now widely used as a tool for gene expression profiling. It detects differentially expressed genes between conditions. For my project, I am looking at clear cell renal cell carcinoma stage i and people who self-report is while male versus black/African American.
- The objective is to identify differentially expressed genes by using Bioconductor.

## Data
- This link is where I got the data. [GDC Data Protal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov). Ten data files of white male clear cell renal cell carcinoma stage i and ten data files of black/African American male clear cell renal cell carcinoma stage i.

## Milestone 1
- I want to filter ten data files of white male and ten data files of black/African American from GDC Data Portal. Then, I want to download the data files in HT-seq format and import them into R.

## Milestone 2
- I want to analyze tha data that can turn raw counts into biological insights and generate some plots.

## Deliverable:
- R Markdown
